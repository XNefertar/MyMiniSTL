# Mini-STL
### Welcome to Mini-STL!

I am a __C++ beginner__, and this is my __independent project__ to build __a mini version of the Standard Template Library (STL)__. The goal of this project is to implement some fundamental STL containers from scratch while ensuring they meet essential usage needs.

To push my learning further, I’ve also taken on the challenge of incorporating __thread-safety mechanisms__, even though this is quite difficult for me at my current level. I believe that experimenting with new concepts will help me grow, and I’m eager to explore multithreading solutions within this context.

I warmly welcome your feedback and suggestions! Whether you spot bugs, have performance tips, or ideas for new features, I’d love to collaborate and improve the project together.

Thank you for your interest and support! Let's build this __mini-STL__ together.
